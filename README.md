# Updated-Portfolio

## Description
For this project, I created an updated version of my existing portfolio.
The portfolio content now includes 4 of my best projects with screenshots and links to each respective GitHub repo and the deployed version.
My portfolio also includes a resume page with a downloadable version and links to GitHub and  LinkedIn.
Finally, I updated the styling of the portfolio with my own color scheme and background and made sure 
this project was mobile responsive.  
The rest of the assignment was updating and improving our Github, LinkedIn, and Resumes.


My portfolio is deployed to GitHub Pages:
